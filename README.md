# Supercollider L-systems
This is a set of supercollider compositions to musicially illustrate some l-systems I wrote.

Last year I worked a bit on @avanka 's lsystems drawing tool. That was fun. I wanted color and was obliged. I made some plant life.

Now, I rediscovered an L-System composition thingy from http://sccode.org/1-5bp it's fun. 

This repo contains:
* Systems for avankas views
* scd files realizing a musical composition of said system
* an image of the view
* a recording of the super collider program
